# XYZ Providers — NDIS Demo Site (v2)

- Adds **high-quality stock photos** via Unsplash Source URLs (care/disability/community).
- Adds **subtle scroll-in animations** (reveal on view, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- Built mobile-first, accessible, and ready for GitHub Pages.

## Quick deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. New repo (e.g., `xyz-providers-v2`).
2. Upload these files.
3. Settings → Pages → Source: `main` / `/root`.
4. Replace `[Suburb]`, phone, email, and provider number in `index.html`.

## Notes
- Photos load from Unsplash on the fly (no need to host images). Replace the URLs with your own later if needed.
